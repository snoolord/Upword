                    2. Right click the selection and look for "Look Upword" in the context menu <br/>
                    3. The Upword module presents words separated by part of speech and synonyms split by definition <br/>
                    4. Hovering over synonyms will change the word that was looked up in Gmail. <br/>
                    Upword can work on many different text fields but only Gmail is supported right now
